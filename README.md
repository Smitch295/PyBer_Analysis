# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to identify the difference in the number of rides, number of drivers, total fares, average fare by per ride, and average by per driver by city type. our goal is too see what factor or factors could be contributing to ride share accessibility. 
## Results
From our analysis we see that Urban cities have the highest number of drivers, rides, and total fare but the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Suburban has the second highest number of drivers, rides, and total fares but theaverage fare per ride and average fare per driver is higher than that of the urban city type. Finally, rural has the lowest number of total rides, drivers, and fare but the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is higher than that of both the urban city type and the suburban city type.

## Summary 
A few tips to help improve disparities among the city types are:
* Creating a reward system for total of number of rides taken for cities with low number of rides . For example if a rider takes 10 rides the 11th ride would be discounted or free.
* Where total rides are high and drivers are low give riders the option of walking a small distance to there ride in order to save money. 
* Offer different means of transportation when driver avalibility might be low.
